# Introduction
This repository contains code for predicting product demand using machine learning techniques. The project focuses on leveraging historical data to create a predictive model that can help businesses better manage their inventory and plan for future demand.

# Dependencies
List all the dependencies required to run the code. Include the libraries and versions you used. For example:

Python (>= 3.6)
NumPy (>= 1.19.5)
Pandas (>= 1.1.5)
Scikit-Learn (>= 0.24.2)
Matplotlib (>= 3.3.4)
Seaborn (>= 0.11.1)
You can include installation instructions for these dependencies in the "Getting Started" section.

Getting Started
Provide step-by-step instructions for setting up the environment and running the code.

# Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/SoundharyaBaranidharan/ADS_Phase-1.git
cd product-demand-prediction
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Dataset
Explain how to obtain and prepare the dataset. If the dataset is too large to include in the repository, provide a link or instructions for downloading it.

Download the dataset from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chakradharmattapalli/product-demand-prediction-with-machine-learning]
or use the provided data.csv file.

Place the dataset in the data directory.

Optionally, preprocess the data, e.g., handle missing values or feature engineering, by running a preprocessing script:

bash
Copy code
python data_preprocessing.py
Usage
Explain how to use your code to make predictions. Provide sample code and usage examples. For example:

python
Copy code
from demand_prediction import DemandPredictor

# Load the pre-trained model
model = DemandPredictor.load_model('trained_model.pkl')

# Predict demand for a specific product
product_features = {
    'product_id': 123,
    'unit_price': 19.99,
    'days_since_last_order': 7,
    # Include other relevant features
}

predicted_demand = model.predict(product_features)
print(f"Predicted demand: {predicted_demand}")
Model Training
Explain how to train the machine learning model using your code. Provide sample code and specify any required input data and parameters. For example:

python
Copy code
from demand_prediction import DemandPredictor

# Load and preprocess the dataset
X, y = DemandPredictor.load_and_preprocess_data('data.csv')

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = DemandPredictor.split_data(X, y)

# Train a machine learning model
model = DemandPredictor.train_model(X_train, y_train)

# Save the trained model
model.save_model('trained_model.pkl')
Evaluation
Explain how to evaluate the model's performance. Provide sample code and metrics used for evaluation. For example:

python
Copy code
from demand_prediction import DemandPredictor

# Load the pre-trained model
model = DemandPredictor.load_model('trained_model.pkl')

# Evaluate the model on the test dataset
test_predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate evaluation metrics
metrics = DemandPredictor.evaluate_model(y_test, test_predictions)

print("Model Evaluation Metrics:")
print(metrics)
# Results
Summarize the results of the product demand prediction. Include any visualizations or insights that might be helpful for users.

# Contributing
Explain how others can contribute to your project, such as submitting bug reports, feature requests, or code contributions. Provide guidelines for code formatting and pull request.

# Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project was sourced from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chakradharmattapalli/product-demand-prediction-with-machine-learning]
. It contains historical data on product demand, and it is used for training and testing the machine learning model. If you plan to provide a direct download link, you can include it here.

Please make sure to give appropriate credit to the dataset source if required.

# Dataset Description
The dataset used for this product demand prediction project is designed to help businesses anticipate future product demand based on historical data. Here is a brief description of the dataset:

Dataset Name: [kaggle.com]
Dataset Source: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chakradharmattapalli/product-demand-prediction-with-machine-learning]

Data Format: The dataset is typically provided in a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format, but it can vary depending on the source.
Dataset Columns:

product_id: A unique identifier for each product.
unit_price: The price of the product per unit.
days_since_last_order: The number of days since the last order for the product.
[Other Relevant Features]: Depending on the dataset, there might be additional features like product category, customer information, etc.
demand: The target variable, representing the product demand.
Objective:

The primary goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict product demand based on the given features. This predictive model can assist businesses in making informed decisions about inventory management, production planning, and supply chain optimization.

# Dataset Preprocessing:

Before using the dataset for machine learning, it's recommended to perform data preprocessing, which may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

# Data Split:

The dataset is typically split into training and testing subsets to train and evaluate the machine learning model. The training data is used to train the model, while the testing data is used to assess its performance and generalization.

# Model Evaluation:

The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) to assess its accuracy and reliability in predicting product demand.

By leveraging this dataset and machine learning techniques, businesses can enhance their inventory management processes, optimize resource allocation, and improve customer satisfaction by ensuring products are available when needed.
